Completed this through refining code in my Prototype. 
Things such as: Removing unnecessary items out of Update functions. 
Removing GetComponent out of updates. Re-writing bools to exclude "==". 
Re-naming variables.
Removing unnecessary spacing.
Hiding in Inspector public variables that are assigned through script but still need to be accessed by other scripts.
And more...
